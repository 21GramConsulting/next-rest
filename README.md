# Yo!

I see there's A LOT of traction here.
Just noticed a few hundreds of clones & this & that.

This repo is heavily work in progress.

I'm trying to shovel our internal Next.JS REST server &Â client
convenience APIs in a stable pile, but of-course stumble upon:
* solutions that aren't generic enough for the world, so gotta do some code sculpting
* IP challenges. We are a company, you know.
* Funny changes between Next 12 and 13 && useSWR 2 and 3

Because of these, sure, feel free to clone or even depend
on master if so curious or hasty. But don't expect API stability.

**Once this stuff is stable and released, it'll be published to NPM**
