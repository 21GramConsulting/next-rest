 * encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of
 * performing the request. Except when responding to a
 * HEAD request, the server should include an entity
 * containing an explanation of the error situation, and
 * indicate whether it is a temporary or permanent
 * condition. Likewise, user agents should display any
